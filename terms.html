        <strong style="font-size:2.1rem; color:#00aaff; display:block; margin-bottom:1.8rem;">Binding Terms for All Clients – Indian & Foreign</strong>

        These terms govern all services provided by Swadesh Link globally. By using our services or making any payment, you agree to be bound by these terms. **All rules apply equally and mandatorily to Indian and foreign clients.**

        <br><br><strong>Important Note – Company Growth Phase</strong><br>
        As a growing company, we are continuously expanding our services to more countries and sectors. Some services may not be available in certain regions yet — we are working hard to make everything available soon. Thank you for your patience and trust.

        <br><br><strong>1. Mandatory Reading of Terms</strong><br>
        You **must read and fully understand** these Terms & Conditions before starting any work. Work will only begin after you confirm in writing (email or message) that you have read, understood, and agree to all terms.

        <br><br><strong>2. Scope of Services</strong><br>
        Swadesh Link provides professional services in **every sector worldwide** — Government, Private, IT/AI/Robotics, Visa/Legal, Real Estate, Vehicles, Payments, Investments, Business Setup, Courses & more — across all countries and languages. Services are subject to local laws, government rules, and third-party requirements.

        <br><br><strong>3. Payment Policy (Strict & Mandatory)</strong><br>
        • Private / Non-Government Services (IT, AI, Real Estate, Business Setup, Investments, etc.): <strong>50% advance payment required</strong> before work begins. Remaining <strong>50%</strong> due only after successful completion and written client satisfaction — fully legal, secure & documented.<br>
        • Government-related Services (Aadhaar, PAN, Passport, Visa, Attestation, Filings, etc.): <strong>100% full advance payment mandatory</strong> due to non-refundable government fees, third-party charges and fixed processing timelines. Work commences **only after full payment receipt** — no exceptions allowed.<br>
        • All payments are final and non-refundable except in proven company fault cases.<br>
        • No work starts without cleared payment.

        <br><br><strong>4. Client Responsibility for Information</strong><br>
        If the client provides **incorrect, false, incomplete, misleading, or wrong information** (related to any person, document, process, or requirement), and due to this the work cannot be completed, gets delayed, rejected, or fails — **the client is fully responsible**. **No refund** of any payment will be given in such cases. This rule applies strictly to **all clients — Indian and foreign**.

        <br><br><strong>5. Misbehavior, Threats, or Refusal to Pay</strong><br>
        If the client threatens, misbehaves, uses abusive language, refuses payment after receiving completed services, attempts blackmail, intimidation, or any form of coercion — the company will immediately initiate **legal action** (civil, criminal, or both) under applicable Indian and international laws. This rule applies equally to **Indian and foreign clients**.

        <br><br><strong>6. Company Obligation & Refund</strong><br>
        If the company is unable to complete the agreed services within the committed timeframe **solely due to its own proven fault, negligence, or default**, or if the services are legally deficient, the client is entitled to a **full 100% refund** of all paid amounts. Any additional compensation will follow the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 or applicable laws.

        <br><br><strong>7. No Free Consultation or Advice</strong><br>
        No free consultation, advice, or detailed information will be provided in any sector. Clients must contact only when ready for **paid services**. Free or casual queries will not be answered.

        <br><br><strong>8. Governing Law & Jurisdiction</strong><br>
        All matters shall be governed by Indian law. All disputes shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the competent courts in Panipat, Haryana, India. These provisions apply equally and mandatorily to all Indian and foreign clients / parties.

        <br><br><strong>9. Changes to Terms</strong><br>
        We may update these terms at any time. Continued use of services after changes means acceptance.

        <br><br><span class="important">Important Final Note:</span> Any act of bad faith, fraud, false representation, intentional non-payment, or misconduct may attract serious civil and/or criminal consequences under applicable laws (cheating, breach of trust, unfair trade practices, etc.).
